# pycloser
Ð¡lean exit for Python scripts after Ctrl-C. Inspired by [xlab's Closer](https://github.com/xlab/closer) for Go (Golang).
# Usage
```python
from pycloser import defer, listen, close

# Push inform function to stack.
@defer
def inform():
	print('You close programm with Ctrl-C.')

@defer
def goodbuy():
	print('Goodbuy!')

# Listening SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP OS signals. When it sended, listen() pop deferred functions from stack and call its one after the other.
listen()

# Main programm loop
for x in range(1, 10):
	print("{0}: {1}".format(x, input(">> ")))

# Pop deferred functions from stack and call its, if signal was not sended.
close()
```
